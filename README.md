## Denoising
bm3d code:
bm3d_batch.py --images ../../data/noisy/preprocessed --noise-std 30 --save ../../data/noisy/bm3d_out

swinIR is used exactly as their readme says, only redirected output to run different experiments for our work

scripts to run it are in the data folder, this way you can run it as batches. To replicate the paper figures, run the dataset creation python code, then the heatmap script, then computeMAP.py

Check the google drive for the data:
